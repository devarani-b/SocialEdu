Motive
Considering that there is atleast one smart phone in every house and more people are becoming digitally literate,
this project aims to design a prototype for a digital platform that gives an opportunity for girl children to educate 
themselves with the help of volunteers to teach them and empower them to be independent.
Community driven learning platform where people who have interest in teaching but often donâ€™t get time to go and teach will 
upload lectures on various school courses. Solution will motivate volunteers via social platforms.
